# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning application that classifies iris flowers into one of three species: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*. This classic dataset is widely used for beginner-level machine learning tasks due to its simplicity and balanced data distribution.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of an iris flower based on its features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Dataset
The Iris dataset, first introduced by Ronald Fisher, is included in many machine learning libraries. It contains 150 samples with the following columns:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal in cm.
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal in cm.
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal in cm.
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal in cm.
- **Species**: Target variable representing the flower species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, or *virginica*).

### Source
The dataset can be found in:
- [Scikit-learn datasets module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

## Steps Involved
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Import the dataset using libraries like `scikit-learn` or `pandas`.
- Visualize the data to understand patterns and relationships.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing data (though the Iris dataset has no missing values).
- Normalize the feature columns if required.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the dataset using pair plots, scatter plots, and box plots to observe the separability of classes.
- Compute correlations between features.

### 4. Model Development
Choose a classification algorithm for the task:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
- Train the chosen model(s) using the training data.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

### 6. Prediction
- Use the trained model to classify unseen data points.
- Provide the predicted species and the corresponding probability score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## Results
The project aims to achieve a high accuracy (95% or above) in predicting the species of iris flowers. Visualization of decision boundaries and model performance metrics will be presented.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate predictions.
4. Experiment with different models and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

## Key Files
- `iris.csv`: Dataset (if not using built-in datasets).
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project (this file).

## Future Improvements
- Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Add a user-friendly web interface for predictions using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.
- Explore ensemble methods to improve accuracy.
